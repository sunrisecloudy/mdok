//! Cell-isolate dispatch decisions, reified sans-IO. A cell isolate runs one
//! event at a time. A top-level Worker fetch takes the resident-isolate fast
//! path only when the isolate is idle; if the isolate is already pumping an
//! actor event, the fetch must reschedule to the stateless Worker pool — never
//! run nested — carrying its request identity so the reply still lands
//! (`js.rs`). The executor and the production run loop hold the isolate
//! channels and the pool; this is the pure routing they consult, so
//! deterministic harnesses can drive it directly.
//!
//! Small protocol sequencing choices also live here when the executor owns
//! the bytes but not the decision. That keeps the shell mechanical and lets
//! callers exercise the same branch production takes.
