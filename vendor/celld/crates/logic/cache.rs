//! Local hibernation-cache eviction, sans-IO.
//!
//! Idle hibernation preserves each cell's SQLite file so a same-node wake is
//! a rename instead of a remote restore, which saves tens of serial storage
//! round trips per wake. The cost is that a node accumulates one file per
//! cell it has ever hosted, which is unbounded while the durable population
//! is unbounded.
//!
//! The bound can be crude because the cache is PURE OPTIMIZATION: every
//! entry is a copy of state the bucket already holds, so deleting any entry
//! is always correct and costs only a future restore. That makes
//! least-recently-used the whole policy — no fencing, no durability, no
//! ordering constraint to respect.

/// One cached file, as the executor observed it.
