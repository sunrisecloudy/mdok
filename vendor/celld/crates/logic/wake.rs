//! Alarm-wake entry reconciliation, sans-IO — plus the wake key scheme.
//!
//! `WakeCore`'s `decide` is a pure transition; [`Reconcile`] holds the
//! ordering rules an executor must obey while performing it. Any executor —
//! production's async S3 flusher or a deterministic fake — asks for steps and
//! reports outcomes, so the rules cannot diverge between them. The key scheme
//! (`entry_key` / `parse_entry_key`) lives here so both sides share one
