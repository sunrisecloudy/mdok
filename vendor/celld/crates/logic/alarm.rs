//! Alarm retry policy, reified sans-IO. After a handler fails, `celld` persists
//! a backoff in SQLite (`storage.rs`) and abandons the alarm once a bounded
//! number of limit-counting failures accrue. That schedule is a pure function
//! of the row's retry counters; storage is its executor.
//!
//! NOTE: `lifecycle::on_event` models a SEPARATE in-memory attempt backoff. The
//! two converge when `on_event` is wired into production (the
//! `ensure_cell → on_event` slice).
