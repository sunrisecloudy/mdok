//! Peer-authentication predicates, reified sans-IO. The signed-request checks in
//! `peer_auth::verify` — a well-formed identity, a timestamp within the clock
//! window, and replay-cache retention — are pure predicates over scalars, and
//! each is a SECURITY fence. A widened identity charset lets a `target` smuggle
//! a path segment past the WrongTarget check; a one-sided clock window replays
//! an old signature forever; retention below the clock window forgets a nonce
//! while a signature bearing it is still acceptable, reopening the replay hole
//! the cache exists to close. Signing/MAC stays in production; the gates move.
