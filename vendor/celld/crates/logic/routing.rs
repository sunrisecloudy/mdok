//! Whether a failed peer dispatch may be re-sent.
//!
//! A cell runs on exactly one node, so every other node forwards to the
//! owner. When that forward fails, celld must decide between two bad
//! options: fail the caller, or re-send and risk running the request twice.
//! The deciding fact is how far the attempt got. A connection that was never
//! established carried no request bytes, so the owner's cell is untouched and
//! a fresh attempt cannot double-apply. Every other failure — a timeout after
//! the request was written, a truncated body, a decode error — leaves the
//! outcome ambiguous: the owner may have run it and lost the reply. Re-sending
//! those would break at-most-once execution.
//!
//! The case this exists for is a burst of cold activations, where TCP
//! handshakes stall past the client's connect timeout. Those forwards never
//! reached the owner, so surfacing them to the caller is a self-inflicted
//! error.
