# celld

Self-hosted, distributed **Durable Objects**.

celld is an open-source daemon that runs Cloudflare Workers and Durable
Objects on your own machines. Each object is its own SQLite database,
addressed by name and replicated to an
S3-compatible bucket you own; nodes coordinate through that bucket alone, with
no control plane or consensus. Because every object is its own small database,
applications shard by construction — the contention and blast-radius failures
of one shared database are designed out, not managed. Idle cells hibernate to
nearly nothing. Learn more at [celld.dev](https://celld.dev) or read the
[documentation](https://celld.dev/docs).

## How it works

Every `celld` node embeds V8 and executes Wrangler bundles. The fleet shares an
S3-compatible bucket containing deployments, cell state, and small ownership
records. Object-storage compare-and-swap ensures that exactly one node owns a
cell at a time, without a membership protocol, failure detector, or consensus
service.

celld continuously replicates each cell's SQLite database to the bucket.
When a cell moves or wakes up, its new owner restores that database and resumes
execution. The bucket is the durable source of truth; nodes are replaceable.

## Install

The installer downloads the `celld` binary (provenance is verifiable with
`gh attestation verify`):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://celld.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Put `~/.local/bin` on your `PATH` if the installer asks you to.

Worker projects deployed with `celld deploy` need
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) on `PATH`; asset-only projects do not.

The installer keeps verified releases under `~/.local/lib/celld/releases` and
atomically switches one `current` pointer. To remove celld, use the guarded
uninstaller:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://celld.dev/uninstall.sh | sh
```

## Container

The release image contains the `celld` binary and is published for Linux
x86-64 and ARM64:

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/denoland/celld --version
```

Persist the runtime's local state and pass the standard AWS credential
environment through:

```sh
docker volume create celld-state
docker run --rm --network host \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  -e CELLD_WATCH=/var/lib/celld/state \
  -v celld-state:/var/lib/celld \
  ghcr.io/denoland/celld \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket \
  --endpoint https://ACCOUNT.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
  --region auto \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --advertise node-a.internal:8080
```

Drop `--endpoint`/`--region` for real AWS S3. Behind a load balancer,
give each node a distinct `--advertise` its peers can reach.

## Run it

celld uses the standard AWS credential chain. Deploy to an S3-compatible
bucket, then start celld against the same bucket:

```sh
celld deploy . \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket

celld \
  --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --advertise 10.0.0.12:8080
```

Use `--endpoint` for another S3-compatible service and `--region` when it
cannot be inferred. A fleet runs one application, and every node loads its
latest successfully committed deployment from `deploy/current.json`. Run
`celld --help` for the complete command line.
Deployment objects use the documented types in `crates/celld/protocol.rs`. `celld
deploy` invokes `esbuild` from `PATH` for Worker code, accepts the supported
Wrangler config subset—including co-deployed or asset-only static
assets—and writes those objects directly. Every node discovers owners and
peers from bucket leases; there is no account or join service.

Peer HTTP does not terminate TLS. Put every advertised address on a trusted
private network or an encrypted overlay such as WireGuard or Tailscale; do not
publish the peer port directly. A literal public IP is rejected unless
`--unsafe-public-advertise` is supplied explicitly. The first current node creates
`fleet/peer-auth.json` in the bucket. All peer requests are protocol-versioned,
body-bound, HMAC-authenticated, clock-bounded, and replay-protected with that
fleet secret. Treat access to the bucket and its credentials as fleet
administrator access.

## Operate a fleet

`celld diagnose` enumerates every node lease by default, then performs a signed
direct probe of each live peer:

```sh
celld diagnose --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket
```

The report keeps checking after an individual failure and distinguishes
expired records, malformed or unsafe advertise addresses, unreachable peers,
and incompatible protocols. It also prints each node's coarse resident-cell,
WebSocket, RSS, CPU, file-descriptor, pressure, and shedding sample. Pass one
or more `--peer NODE_ID` options to restrict the check.

Pressure shedding is opt-in while the first release's safe defaults are being
measured. Set a resident-cell high and low watermark on loaded nodes:

```sh
CELLD_MAX_RESIDENT_CELLS=1000 \
CELLD_RESIDENT_LOW_WATER=800 \
celld --bucket s3://my-cells-bucket --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --advertise node-a.internal:8080
```

On Linux, `CELLD_MAX_RSS_MB` and `CELLD_MAX_CPU_PERCENT` add process-memory and
CPU triggers; the resident-cell watermark is portable. Under pressure, celld
durably replicates and fences least-recently used idle cells, publishes them as
unowned without resetting their epoch, and refuses to reacquire new unowned
cells until the low watermark is reached. A spare receives no assignment: it
acquires released cells through the same bucket protocol when normal traffic
reaches it. Cells with active work or live host WebSockets are not shed.

## Build from source

```sh
cargo build --locked
cargo test --locked
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
```

The workspace builds the `celld` runtime. Its versioned object-storage
protocol lives in `crates/celld/protocol.rs`. Small Wrangler projects under `examples/`
exercise the supported Worker and Durable Object surface.

The runtime and compatibility surface are still evolving. Public tests cover
the standalone engine smoke path; conformance against the Workers and Durable
Objects reference behavior, and a deterministic simulation of the distributed
protocol under fault injection, run before each release.

Pull requests are disabled. Coding agents make it too easy to send a large,
low-context change that costs maintainers more time than it saves. Thoughtful
contributions are welcome; please understand the code, keep the patch focused,
and respect the review time you are asking for.
